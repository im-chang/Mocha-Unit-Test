# Mocha Unit Testing

By: Mike Chang

The objective of this challenge was to solve the following two problems as well as testing them with Mocha Unit Testing:

    Problem 1: Maximum product
        From an array of numbers, find out the pair of numbers that has the largest product, and return the product.
        Write a method that accepts an array and returns the resulting maximum product.

    An example:
        input: [7, 8, -10, -6, 2, 3]
        output: 60

    Problem 2: Anagrams
        Two strings are anagrams of each other if by rearranging the characters in one string can result in the other one. In this problem, you are to detect whether two given strings are anagrams of each other.

    An example:
        Input: apple Pie and Pineapple
        Output: False

        Input: apple and Paple
        Output: True
